. add support for the discid

using the discid brings this fs some advantages:

a. the fs is faster at startup. the discid contains information which is sufficient for the fs
to show the contents of the cd: number of tracks and the startsector, and thereby the size per track.
It does this a lot faster than the cdio_cddap_open/cdio_cddap_firstsector/cdio_cddap_lastsector/cdio_cddap_tracks calls.

b. it provides an (unique) id which can be used to communicate with free cddb servers to get additional information.

. move read ahead to read call: if everything is found in cache, the cdrom reader
is not activated, and the current read ahead is not done
when in read call (at the end, after fuse_reply) it's always done
